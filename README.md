# Design-of-DNA-Sequence-Alignment
The alignment of DNA sequence is a common practice within the biology arena. The goal of this project is to apply object-oriented skills such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, array list, and etc. to solve realistic and crucial problems within the science society. In this project, the exposure to some algorithms like NEEDLEMAN-WUNSCH is expected, thus an opportunity to understand and analyse such algorithms will be a great asset in the future.  The alignment is basically analyzing two DNA sequences of two different species to check if they are related
